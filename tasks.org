#+Title: Poker App Tasks

* Range Analysis
** DONE Make selected cards deletable
** DONE Remove selected cards from output of range
** DONE Put in algorithm. Display:
*** DONE Text output of each hand strength (how many of them can be made with the range and the board)
** DONE Bugs
*** DONE Overcards: pocket pairs should not be overcards
    EX:AA on a K65 boardshould not be count as overcards
*** DONE Paired boards give funny readouts with errors
    Ex: Range:AKo on 3h3cTs gives 12 middle pair combos (should be 0)
    Maddie says: done for now, re-open if more examples arise
*** DONE Range: QQ, Board: Qs2s3d error thrown in wheel function
*** DONE Random button can create two of the same card
** DONE Design Ideas
*** DONE Show board cards as card pictures instead of text
** TODO Features
*** DONE Clear Button for Board
*** DONE Random Button for Board, fills in three random board cards
*** DONE Combination counter for ranges shows number of pairs in range
*** DONE Clear Button for Range
*** TODO Look into different technologies for converting to an app
** TODO User Expericence Improvments
*** DONE Change order of hand strength output (highest strength first)
*** DONE Drag functionality
*** TODO User input cleansing
**** TODO the same card may be put on the board twice
**** TODO when adding a card multiple ranks can be highlighted
* Situation Drills
** TODO Continuation betting
*** DONE Create a new "app"
**** DONE Change name of files for other app
*** DONE Create a config file for the continuation betting situation
*** DONE Create a module that reads the file and sets up a situation
*** TODO Add button to output range as text
*** TODO Make config file actually right
*** TODO Make display nicer
*** TODO Find a way to "save" that situation once it is completed
* Notes:
Situation type selector
Accepts input on what he decides
sets up a board and hand
configurable
pick position

First situation:
Continuation betting in position against the big blind
In position means button, cutoff, middle, under the gun
Board: random boards are fine, or it would be nice if he
could select one or two cards and it would fill in the others
Hand: depends on the position.
Maybe make a tool to export positions from range so they can be
read in from text.
Pot: $2.75

Will eventually need a way to start a "session" and keep track
of number of hands completed, and a way to export them to text files.

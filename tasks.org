#+Title: Range Analysis

* DONE Make selected cards deletable
* DONE Remove selected cards from output of range
* DONE Put in algorithm. Display:
** DONE Text output of each hand strength (how many of them can be made with the range and the board)
* DONE Bugs
** DONE Overcards: pocket pairs should not be overcards
   EX:AA on a K65 boardshould not be count as overcards
** DONE Paired boards give funny readouts with errors
   Ex: Range:AKo on 3h3cTs gives 12 middle pair combos (should be 0)
   Maddie says: done for now, re-open if more examples arise
** DONE Range: QQ, Board: Qs2s3d error thrown in wheel function
** DONE Random button can create two of the same card
* DONE Design Ideas
** DONE Show board cards as card pictures instead of text
* TODO Features
** DONE Clear Button for Board
** DONE Random Button for Board, fills in three random board cards
** DONE Combination counter for ranges shows number of pairs in range
** DONE Clear Button for Range
** TODO Look into different technologies for converting to an app
* TODO User Expericence Improvments
** DONE Change order of hand strength output (highest strength first)
** TODO Drag functionality
** TODO User input cleansing
*** TODO the same card may be put on the board twice
*** TODO when adding a card multiple ranks can be highlighted

#+Title: Situation Drills

* TODO Continuation betting
** TODO Create a new "app"
*** TODO Change name of files for other app
*** TODO Add flags to the build script to build one app or both
** TODO Create a config file for the continuation betting situation
** TODO Create a module that reads the file and sets up a situation
** TODO Find a way to "save" that situation once it is completed
* Notes:
Situation type selector
Accepts input on what he decides
sets up a board and hand
configurable
pick position

First situation:
Continuation betting in position against the big blind
In position means button, cutoff, middle, under the gun
Board: random boards are fine, or it would be nice if he
could select one or two cards and it would fill in the others
Hand: depends on the position.
Maybe make a tool to export positions from range so they can be
read in from text.
Pot: $2.75

Will eventually need a way to start a "session" and keep track
of number of hands completed, and a way to export them to text files.

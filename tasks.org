#+Title: Poker App Tasks

* Range Analysis
** DONE Make selected cards deletable
** DONE Remove selected cards from output of range
** DONE Put in algorithm. Display:
*** DONE Text output of each hand strength (how many of them can be made with the range and the board)
** DONE Bugs
*** DONE Overcards: pocket pairs should not be overcards
    EX:AA on a K65 boardshould not be count as overcards
*** DONE Paired boards give funny readouts with errors
    Ex: Range:AKo on 3h3cTs gives 12 middle pair combos (should be 0)
    Maddie says: done for now, re-open if more examples arise

* Notes:

Things that might change:
position is variable in every situation
range of hands per position
pot size
options could be raises, calls, or folds
"raises $3.00 to $5.75"

Situation type selector
Accepts input on what he decides
sets up a board and hand
configurable
pick position

Positions: [
  Random,
  BU,
  SB,
  BB,
  UG,
  MP,
  CO
]

First situation:
Continuation betting in position against the big blind
In position means button, cutoff, middle, under the gun
Board: random boards are fine, or it would be nice if he
could select one or two cards and it would fill in the others
Hand: depends on the position.
Maybe make a tool to export positions from range so they can be
read in from text.
Pot: $2.75

Will eventually need a way to start a "session" and keep track
of number of hands completed, and a way to export them to text files.

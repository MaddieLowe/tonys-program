* Notes:

Instructions for adding to a situation:

1) Copy your template file into app/lib/situations/export-templates/ and rename it
   so that it is unique and has no spaces

2) Edit the template so that it contains the following identifiers:

       <HAND_ID>
       <HOLE_CARDS>
       <FLOP> // First three cards
       <BET> // Bet amount
       <TURN> // The turn card
       <BOARD> // Flop and turn

3) Open up your situation config file (ex: app/lib/situations/continuation-betting-vs-bb.js/
   and add the appropriate field under "export_templates"

4) Go to your terminal and run:

       scripts/build situation-drills
